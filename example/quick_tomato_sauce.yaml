     title: Cook the sauce
     ingredients:
       - ingredient:
           name: Basil
           amount: 10+ leaves
           note: Feel free to add more basil leaves to taste.
       - ingredient:
           name: Chili flakes
           amount: 1/4 tsp
           note: For a spicier sauce, add more chili flakes.
       - ingredient:
           name: Crushed Garlic
           amount: 4 cloves
       - ingredient:
           name: Olive Oil
           amount: 1 tbsp
       - ingredient:
           name: Whole canned tomatoes.
           notes:
             - Fresh, very ripe, tomatoes can be used instead.
             - For the best tasting sauce, use high quality canned tomatoes. My favorites are typically D.O.P. labeled San Marzano.
           amount: 16 oz
       - ingredient: Salt
       - ingredient:
           name: Black Pepper
           amount: 1/2 tsp
           note: Always use freshly ground pepper.
       - ingredient:
           name: Parmasean Cheese
           amount: 1/4 cup
     steps:
       - step: In a large bowl, hand crush the tomatoes.
       - step:
           instruction: Heat large skillet on medium heat. Once heated, add olive oil.
           note: Be sure not to let olive oil get too hot (smoking point), as it becomes bitter.
       - step:
          instruction: When olive oil begins to shimmer, add chili flakes, 1/4 tsp black pepper, and crushed garlic. Cook until the garlic just begins to turn a golden brown.
          note: Be careful of burning the garlic, and if it burns - start over.
       - step:
           instruction: Tear basil leaves into smaller pieces.
           notes:
             - Large leaves can be torn into 2-3 pieces, while smaller can either be left whole - or torn as well.
             - Since this is a quick sauce, tearing the leaves helps to enhance the basil's flavor in the sauce.
       - step: Add the crushed tomatoes, remaining 1/4 tsp black pepper, a pinch of salt, and basil to the skillet. Stir, and bring the mixture to a simmer.
       - step:
           instruction: Once the pasta is cooked to al-dente, add pasta and appromixately 1/4 cup of pasta water.
           notes:
             - Reserve additional pasta water incase the sauce appears to be dry, or needs to be further thickened in the next step.
             - The addition of pasta water helps introduce starch, which makes the sauce stick to the pasta better.
       - step: Turn the heat up to high, and stir for approximately one minute. Continue until enough water boils off - and the sauce starts sticking to the pasta.
       - step: Stir in the parmasean cheese and any extra salt if needed. Enjoy!
